# Vacation Website

This is a demo front-end only website for browsing hotel information. It's built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Technologies Used

*   HTML
*   CSS
*   Font Awesome (for icons)

## Features

*   **Navigation:**  A simple navigation bar with links to Home, Book, Blog, and Contact Us pages.
*   **Hero Section:** A visually appealing hero section with a background image, title, and tagline.
*   **Booking Form:** A form for users to search for hotels based on location, check-in/check-out dates, and number of guests.  (Note: This form is currently non-functional as it is a front-end only project.  It would require backend integration to process actual bookings.)
*   **Popular Hotels Section:** Displays a selection of popular hotels with images, names, prices, and locations.
*   **Client Testimonials:** Showcases what clients are saying about the service.
*   **Rewards Section:**  Promotes joining a rewards program for discounts.
*   **Footer:** Contains company information, legal links, and resources.


## How to Run

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Future Improvements

*   **Backend Integration:** Implement backend functionality to handle form submissions, user authentication, and database interaction for real hotel bookings.
*   **JavaScript Enhancements:** Add interactive elements and dynamic content using JavaScript.  For example, you could add date pickers to the form or use JavaScript to filter the hotel listings.
*   **Accessibility:**  Make the website more accessible by following accessibility best practices.
*   **Image Optimization:** Optimize images to improve page load speed.
